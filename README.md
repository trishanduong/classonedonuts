This frontend project is a responsive website I made for a local business, Class One Donuts. 

I primarily focused on creating a landing website that was minimalistic yet fun, introducing light animations using GSAP. Most of my time was spent trying to improve performance, SEO, and the accessibility of this website.

### Key Features:
- Landing Page
- Animated Horizontal Scrolling Gallery
- Mobile Navigation Screen
- Appropriate Navigation Links 
- Business Hours


## Roadmap

- [x] Landing page
- [x] Business Social Media: Instagram, Order, Yelp, Links to Doordash
- [x] Mobile responsiveness as well as a hamburger menu for navigation
- [x] Video embedding (promotional)
- [] Arrow for efficient scrolling up 
- [] Make the Hero more interesting (particularly on the right side) - maybe some animation
